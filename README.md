## frens

SWAMP is hiring! the website is a bot interaction of username, guild, state (live in now or want to live in - this will include our overseas frens which previous iteration did not), biological gender, title in company they wish to earn, if they are open to moving to sanford, fl, then they are asked for signature and must check a box they are accepting the position of "fren" with a $100 signing bonus. they are then told they will receive half of it via cash app but will receive the other $50 in swamp cash. they are first shown how to download coinbase wallet and claim it there in the browser by connecting wallet and entering their username. $50 of liquid swamp cash is sent. 100b tokens so we can chant it's gonna be a $1 one day! 75% of supply locked up in "rucksack" nfts vesting tokens, 25% in a variation of liquidity pools. same wif swamp gold, but those gold nfts (each item has different number of swamp gold tokens). i like the 25/75 ratio but we could do 31/69.. i kinda like that better. so they also are then shown how to download cash app. tell them they should verify to receive bitcoin as well. after walking through that, tell them they have to walk through our own kyc.

## popup events wif shops

these are held all through the state of fl. announced morning of (at 4:20) then people livestream reaction & trips to the event. the top 5 livestreams all get paid in treasure chests (the vested nft for gold). all new frens (just in fl) upon kyc'ng also get a rucksack in the mail (eventually delivered in the night) with the following contents: GR1, 30pd plate, 5 t-shirts, trucker hat, handbook.
